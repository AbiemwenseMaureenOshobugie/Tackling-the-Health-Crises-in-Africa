# Tackling-the-Health-Crises-in-Africa
Overall, Africa has been bedeviled with a range of complex health challenges, including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and mental health issues, as well as a lack of access to quality healthcare for many people.

## Recommendation

African children `Under 5 years` are dieing, presumably from Malaria and Diarrheal and the youths `15 - 49 years` from HIV/AIDS. Stemming from this, the Governments of the African nations need to invest in drugs and other medical resources necessary to fight against Malaria, Diarrheal and HIV/AIDS in  order to reclaim the lives of our children and youths from the claws of these deadly killers.

The percentage of GDP allocated to health expenditure should be readdressed in Africa to be at par with the World, in order to encourage the Medical practitioner to keep practicing in Africa. This will go a long way to increasing the average number of Medical Doctors per `10,000` population available in the Continent.


## Conclusion
Data on health facilities, the facilities state and access to them by the population in Africa would have further enriched the claim of significant number of death. Death caused by diseases like Malaria, diarrheal, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and the likes, could have been avoided, if there were adequate medical resources (drugs and timely medical attention). On the other hand, the effect of health facility proximity on death could not be ascertained as the data did not cover that aspect.
